            <h2>Why</h2>
            <p>Graduation is around the corner, implying the end of the first chapter of my life. The wind of December passes through my and carries away all the words that I have not dared to say or have yet to findd the meaning to say. Though the road ahead remains foggy, I believe it's time to either embark on a new journey or watch everything rot for the rest of my life.</p>
            <h2>How</h2>
            <p>For personal preference, GitHub Pages with plain HTML and CSS is more than sufficient, the document is well-written and easy to follow, which leads to a quite smooth experience. GPT-4o mini did most of the coding for me, and with minimal prompt, the generated color theme and layout was basically all I wanted, requiring only a few minor adjustment.</p>
            <p>The only frustration I faced was when I tried to add my LinkedIn account, the accout got restricted after login and I was told to upload my ID to recover. I haven't posted anything since registering and the only things that could be wrong were my IP address and browser extensions. It's so difficult to understand the point behind LinkedIn's anti-spam policy.</p>
            <h2>Next</h2>
            <p>1. Automate the process of converting Markdown to HTML, updating archive list and atom file.</p>
            <p>2. Add support for mobile device with small display.</p>
